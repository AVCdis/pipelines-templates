#Example template for a GCP Pipeline using Cloud Build Service in a process of building, testing, and deploying a web application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

1. Code Repository: Developers push code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub or Cloud Source Repositories).
2. Trigger Build: Cloud Build is configured to trigger a build process whenever code is pushed to the repository.
3. Build Process:
  Step 1: Pull the latest code from the repository.
  Step 2: Run automated tests to ensure the code is working as expected.
  Step 3: Build Docker images of the application.
  Step 4: Push the Docker images to Container Registry.
4. Deploy to GKE:
  Step 5: Deploy the Docker images to a GKE cluster.
  Step 6: Run integration tests to verify the deployment.
5. Notification: Notify the team via Slack or email about the build and deployment status.
